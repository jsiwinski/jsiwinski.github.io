## Introduction

Charles Oliveira stunned the world over the summer using a counter left
to win the Lightweight belt over Michael Chandler. His next opponent is
no easy task. Dustin Poirier has all of the momentum with two big wins
over The Notorious Conor McGregor. This card is loaded with interesting
matchups and this post breaks it all down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Olivera vs. Poirier 

Charles Olivera is a +135 Vegas Underdog, but has the edge over Poirier with our model at 59%.

#### Striking

The two fighters have similar significant strike outputs in their careers. Offensively no one gains an edge in this category. However, Poirier has a better Knockdown rate in comparison to Olivera.

Defensively, Poirier has shown to take a lot more signfiicant strikes than Olivera. This was shown most in Poirier's wars with Justin Gaethje and Dan Hooker. 

**Advantage = Slightly Poirier**

#### Ground Game

Among the two fighters, Poirier is the more aggressive fighter when going for takedowns. I am most interested to see how Poirier approaches this aspect of the fight. Will Olivera's dangerous submission history and overall ground game deter Poirier from taking it to the ground? Personally, I believe so. Olivera has a much better defensive Takedown rate compared to Poirier. Opponents simply don't want the fight going to the ground against Olivera. 

When on the ground, Olivera is the better fighter and holds an elite offensive pass record. Look for Olivera to mix in some takedowns of his own to exploit this skill and end the fight. 

**Advantage = Olivera**
